# Hockey Game Prediction Project

A machine learning project to predict NHL hockey game outcomes.

## Setup

### Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hockey_modelling
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Test Connection

First, test if you can connect to the NHL API:

```bash
python test_connection.py
```

If the connection works, you'll see a list of NHL teams. If it fails, check your network connection and DNS settings.
